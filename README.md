This repository contains a simple example of a common runtime error in Hack caused by not properly handling nullable optional integer parameters.  The `bug.hack` file demonstrates the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.hack` file shows the correct way to resolve the error.  This is a common error for developers transitioning to Hack from other languages that may have more relaxed null handling.
